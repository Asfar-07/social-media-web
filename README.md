# Social Media

This project holds a special place for me — it is my **first college project (2023–2024)**.
After losing it for some time, I was able to recover it, and every line of code brings back meaningful memories from my learning journey.

This project was built as a **team effort**, where we faced multiple challenges during development, including security concerns and code readability issues.
Despite these challenges, we did our best to design and implement a functional social media platform while learning real-world development practices.
